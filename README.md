# YazDHCP

## v1.0.8

### Updated on 2025-May-26

## About

Feature expansion of DHCP assignments using AsusWRT-Merlin's [Addons API](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/Addons-API) to read and write DHCP assignments, increasing the limit on the number of reservations.

YazDHCP is free to use under the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (GPL 3.0).

## Supported firmware versions

You must be running firmware Merlin 384.15/384.13_4 or later [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/)

## Installation

Using your preferred SSH client/terminal, copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

```sh
/usr/sbin/curl -fsL --retry 3 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMTM-OSR/YazDHCP/master/YazDHCP.sh" -o "/jffs/scripts/YazDHCP" && chmod 0755 /jffs/scripts/YazDHCP && /jffs/scripts/YazDHCP install
```

## Usage

YazDHCP leverages the existing [LAN - DHCP Server](http://router.asus.com/Advanced_DHCP_Content.asp) page in the AsusWRT-Merlin WebUI. It has been modified under the hood to read and write to files in /jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/ via the Addons API.

This allows us to use a greater amount of storage (6KB vs 2.5-3KB) for DHCP host assignments.

To launch the command line menu for YazDHCP after installation, use:

```sh
YazDHCP
```

If you do not have Entware installed, you will need to use the full path:

```sh
/jffs/scripts/YazDHCP
```

## Changes made to dnsmasq configuration

YazDHCP adds 3 lines to dnsmasq.conf.add to configure DHCP reservations:

```sh
addn-hosts=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.hostnames # YazDHCP_hostnames
dhcp-hostsfile=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.staticlist # YazDHCP_staticlist
dhcp-optsfile=/jffs/addons/YazDHCP.d/.optionslist # YazDHCP_optionslist
```

addn-hosts contains a list of IP address to hostname mappings, for DNS resolution of DHCP reserved clients
dhcp-hostsfile contains a list of MAC address to IP address bindings, to reserve a DHCP IP address for a MAC address
dhcp-optsfile contains a list of MAC address to DNS server address bindings, to provide the specified DNS server as a DHCP option for a MAC address

## "DHCP Lease" time values

The "DHCP Lease" input field has been enhanced to accept a maximum value of 7776000 seconds (90 days). Values can be entered in seconds (e.g. 86400s), minutes (e.g. 1440m), hours (e.g. 24h), days (e.g. 2d), or weeks (e.g. 2w). A single digit ZERO '0' or an upper-case letter 'I' indicates that an "infinite" lease time value will be applied.

## "Back up & Restore" custom user icons

You can save a backup of the custom user icons found in the "/jffs/usericons" directory, and you can later select one of the backup files to restore the icons files as needed. The command line interface allows you to change the directory path where the backup subdirectory is located, and you have option to delete backup files, or list the contents of a backup file. The default maximum number of backup files to keep is 20, but you can change this maximum setting (between min=5 to max=50) using the CLI menu.

### NOTES

1) The current implementation of the "Back up & Restore" of custom user icons does *NOT* export to or import from an external PC or client device connected to the router. Instead, it targets a directory available either on the router's JFFS partition or in a USB-attached disk drive. This target directory is where the subdirectory for backups is created and can be modified using the CLI menu (see note #3 below).
2) The CLI main menu option 2 for the "Back up & Restore" functionality will show up only if there is at least one custom user icon file found in the "/jffs/usericon" directory, or if at least one backup file is found in the directory path defined for backups. If none of those 2 conditions is met, the option 2 will not show up in the main menu.
3) To start using the "Back up & Restore custom user icons" feature, it's highly recommended to set the target directory where the subdirectory for backups is to be located (see option "dp" in the CLI menu). For the backups subdirectory to survive a "Factory Defaults Reset" of the router, it's highly recommended to use a directory path located on a disk drive plugged in to one of the router's USB ports. You don't have to have Entware installed on the USB-attached disk; any USB disk drive formatted with either NTFS or ext4 is sufficient to use as storage for the backup files.

### Scarf Gateway

Installs and updates for this addon are redirected via the [Scarf Gateway](https://about.scarf.sh/scarf-gateway) by [Scarf](https://about.scarf.sh/about). This allows me to gather data on the number of new installations of my addons, how often users check for updates and more. This is purely for my use to actually see some usage data from my addons so that I can see the value provided by my continued work. It does not mean I am going to start charging to use my addons. My addons have been, are, and will always be completely free to use.
